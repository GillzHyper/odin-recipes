    <h2> we can all agree that nothing beats homemade goods, espesscially whens its made using simple ingredients, minimal stress and most importantly, <strong><em>Love.</em></strong></h2>
     <p>However, there is one problem, beginners dont know where to start when trying to make good food that they can enjoy without the fear of messing up. Which is exactly why i decided to create my very own recipe page, to share simple, delicious food that can bring people together over the wonder of food.</p>

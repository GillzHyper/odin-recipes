   <p>  </p><h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            dough(can be found at local bakeries)
        </li>
        <li>
            pizza sauce(tomatoe paste will do fine)
           
        </li>
        <li>
            cheese( I recommend buying the large slabs of cheese and grating them yourself) 
        </li>

    <p></p><h2>Steps</h2>

    </ul>
    <p>Now that we have our ingredients, its time to start cooking by following these simple instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface(you can use your counter), stretch the dough into circle. slowly move it onto a non-stick baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon to spread the pizza sauce onto the dough, make sure to leave the edges completly untouched to form that crust</li>
        <li>sprinkle your cheese over the pizza sauce (no need to be shy)</li>
        <li> put the sheet into the oven for roughly 10 minutes at 425 digrees, make sure to check it occasionally</li>
        <li>
            Enjoy
        </li>
    </ol>
